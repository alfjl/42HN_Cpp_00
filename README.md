# 42_Cpp_Module_00

The goal of the **C++ modules 00 to 08** is to introduce the student to Object-Oriented Programming and the C++ programming language in general.
Because of the complexity of the language, the students code has to comply with the C++98 standard.

**C++ module 00** introduces the learner to fundamental concepts like namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff.

## Description

ex00:  
Write a short C++ program, that takes a/multiple string/s from the command line and displays them IN ALL CAPS on the standard out.  
(first intro to std::cin and std::cout)

ex01:  
Write a program that behaves like a "crappy awesome phonebook software" from the 80s. Functionality is limited to ADD a contact, SEARCH for a contact and EXIT the program.  
(first intro to classes)

ex02:  
From the content of tests.cpp and Account.hpp, re-engineer how the 'account class' was implemented and code the Account.cpp yourself.  
(understand the workings of constructors and destructors of C++ classes)

## Learnings

This was a great first refresher of the knowledge I gained in my C++ course 2021. Looking forward to the other projects of this module and getting back into the C++ rhythm.
